<b>How do I place my order?</b>
Our @pwintogrambot will help with your order. Send all the stickers you want to print, you can even send whole sticker sets. No worries, you can edit your cart at any point before you finalize your order.

<b>How much does it cost?</b>
The price is fixed to $1.89 per sticker for a 3x4 inches / 7.6x10.1 centimeters size, this is the only size we currently provide since Telegram sticker format doesn't allow good quality printing on bigger sizes.

<b>How is payment handled</b>
Pwintogram uses Telegram Payment to gather your shipping information and handle payment, your card number will never be shared with us and the transaction is secured by the trusted Stripe platform.

<b>What will my stickers look like</b>
We will show you a preview of your stickers at every step, each sticker will be processed to scale them slightly and remove the shadow effect that most Telegram stickers use.
